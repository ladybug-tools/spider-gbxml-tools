### Commit message prefixes

From [The case for single character git commit message prefixes]( https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/10/04/the-case-for-single-character-git-commit-message-prefixes )

* B, indicates a bugfix.
* F, indicates a feature or a change - this will most likely be the majority of the commits.
* a, code formatting change.
* c, comments and or documentation.
* D, dependency updates.
* R, code refactoring, note that this is different from r below.
* r, proven code refactoring - this is the original meaning of the mathematical term refactoring, where it can be mathematically proven that the code change does not change any functionality.
* T, test cases and/or test improvements
* !, unknown - i.e. for when you really need to make that commit because there's a horde of zombies waiting outside.
