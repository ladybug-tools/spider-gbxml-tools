# Spider gbXML Manifold Read Me

<details open >

<summary>Concept</summary>

* Ascertain if a collection of points is water tight or manifold

### Request: Add "water-tight" functionality so an imperfect model can be sealed 100%

[Issue 19]( https://github.com/GreenBuildingXML/GreenBuildingXML.github.io/issues/19)

This is per a Trane TRACE 3D project manager: The only way to import a gbXML model into TRACE 3D is one that is 100% watertight. Since most models exported by Revit are NOT watertight, there needs to be a way to make it tight. The gbXML viewer could help.

### Define "Manifold"

Manifold: a collection of points forming a certain kind of set, such as those of a topologically closed surface or an analog of this in three or more dimensions.

"watertight"

* closely sealed, fastened, or fitted so that no water enters or passes through.
