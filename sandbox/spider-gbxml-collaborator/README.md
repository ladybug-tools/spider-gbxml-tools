# Spider gbXML Collaborator Read Me


<details open >

<summary>Concept</summary>

From time to time several people may need to collaborate on the same gbXML file.

Spider gbXML Collaborator is an attempt to create a script tht operates on a collaborative manner - similar to the way that Google Docs operates.

This project is an early stage work-in-progress. Only camera rotation, zoom distance and text messages are synchronized. More features will be added in future versions.

When viewing models, the file must be loaded by clicking the same button on each instance.

If the model appears to be moving by itself, there is probably somebody updating the model at the same time you are. All differences are same to the same single file at [jsonbox.io]( https://jsonbox.io/ )
