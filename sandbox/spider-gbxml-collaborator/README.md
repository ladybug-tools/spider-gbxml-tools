## [Spider gbXML Collaborator]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/sandbox/spider-gbxml-collaborator/v-0-01/spider-gbxml-collaborator.html )

From time to time several people may need to collaborate on the same gbXML file.

Spider gbXML Collaborator is an attempt to create a script tht operates on a collaborative manner - similar to the way that Google Docs operates.

This project is an early stage work-in-progress. Only camera rotation, zoom distance and text messages are synchronized. More features will be added in future versions.

When viewing models, the file must be loaded by clicking the same button on each instance.

If the model appears to be moving by itself, there is probably somebody updating the model at the same time you are. All differences are same to the same single file at [jsonbox.io]( https://jsonbox.io/ )


### Usage

Open this script in two tabs, windows or devices. Check the 'editor' box in one tab and rotate the model or enter a message in the text box. Press 'send data to server' and see the other tab update.
