# Dev Notes

## 2019-11-08

* v0-18 first lines of code

Objectives

* Intended to be very light-weight
* More smaller modules
* Each module includes some testing
* Each ships with "use strict" and passes jsHint
* Passing esLint would be nice
* Based of good use of HTML semantics (nav,header,footer,artcle tags etc)
* CSS follows BEM standard
* Plain-vanilla JavaScript
* Easy code to read
* Highly descriptive folder, file, object, function and variable names
* Would like a fun, pretty release
