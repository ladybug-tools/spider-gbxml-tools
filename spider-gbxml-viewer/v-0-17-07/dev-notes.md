Fastest way to view gbXML files

Problem: You are onsite on a project in some unknown place working on an unknown device and you need to view and fix the project's gbXML file. It's not your device so you have no bookmarks or browsing history. Time is of the essence. You need to get things done now.

So what are you gong to do? What would [MacGyver]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver ) do?

* Open the browser
* Type just five letters in the address bar: "gbxml"
* Press enter then click on the first entry.
* When the menu appears, click "Viewer"
* In a few seconds the latest stable version of the Ladybug Tools / Spider gbXML Viewer appears
* Bingo! Load your file and start viewing and fixing

And then, once your impossible mission is complete, do go back and have a look to the gbXML.org web site. Note

* The numerous organizations and their many apps that support gbXML
* The schema embodying twenty years of experience - still readable by a normal human being
* The ongoing development and collaboration as recorded in the news page

And for all this we owe a tip of the hat to Stephen Roth of [Carmel Software]( https://www.carmelsoft.com/ ). Stephen is a good example of the truth that software is not magic that just appears but is the result of human effort replete with diligence, patience and vision.

Do you have a faster way af getting to your gbXML files from anywhere? Got any good gbXML tips?
